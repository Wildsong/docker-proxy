# docker-proxy

This project uses jwilder/nginx-proxy to build a container that
will automatically add and remove reverse proxy setups using nginx
and jwilder's dockergen daemon.

It uses JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion to 
automatically set up to maintain and use Let's Encrypt certificates.
(2019-11-09 Updated to v1.12 to support ACME V2)

Each container that you want to proxy needs 3 things.

* It needs to define VIRTUAL_HOST with a unique name, because the proxy
uses that name to create its entry for the service.
* It needs to use proxy_net as its network so that the proxy can see the service.
* It needs to EXPOSE the port you want to proxy.

Create the network, I use Docker Swarm so I use an overlay network.
I make it "attachable" so that it can be shared among different apps.

```bash
   docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable proxy_net
``` 

Example for pi-hole; in the docker-compose.yml for pi-hole I have

```
  networks:
    - proxy-net
  environment:
    VIRTUAL_HOST: pihole.wildsong.biz
    VIRTUAL_PORT: 80 # This is only needed if you run on a different port.
  expose:
    - "80"
```

If you want the proxy to set up an SSL certificate too then it needs more:

```
  environment:
    LETSENCRYPT_HOST: pihole.wildsong.biz
    LETSENCRYPT_MAIL: webmaster@wildsong.biz   (This line is optional but a good idea)
```

I created the dhparam volume and copied my old nginx dhparam.pem file
into it but you can let it create one for you and skip this.

```
docker volume create proxy_dhparam
sudo cp dhparam.pem /home/docker/volumes/proxy_dhparam/_data/
docker volume create proxy_certs
sudo cp -r /etc/letsencrypt/* /home/docker/volumes/proxy_certs/_data/
```

Also I created the certs volume and copied my old /etc/letsencrypt
files into it.

If you don't need to preserve old files you can just forget this and
let docker create new (empty) volumes for you.

### Swarm vs Compose

I have used Docker Compose in the testing phase for this project but I
find that the order in which containers start is important, and if I
run Docker Swarm instead then containers can die and restart a few
times until they all come online so order does not matter.

There are "depends_on" settings for Compose that will be ignored in Swarm.

2021-02-04 SWARM NOT WORKING -- because docker-gen needs to know the
containerId for nginx.  There is a PR to fix this, someday it will go
in and I can change over so FOR NOW IT'S DOCKER-COMPOSE or nothing. :-(


### Content under the same domain name

The main app is mapproxy, which grabs https://giscache/
but I want to run other services under the same name,
for example https://giscache/photoshow/ and
https://giscache/property/ which run in separate containers.

This is done with a customized config in vhost.d/giscache file

For example, this is the entry for the property api.

```bash
# Property App API photo service
location /photo {
  proxy_pass http://property/photo:5002;
}
```

#### Static IP addresses

In docker-compose I have each of the proxied things nailed down to an ip address
so that I can bring up this container (proxy) and the names will resolve correctly
even if the linked containers are down. I think this might resolve the thing that
happens every Sunday when all the containers forget how to talk to each other.

#### Edits in the config file

Important note: the container (one of them, I don't know which) edits
the vhosts.d files on startup and shutdown. So the drill is, stop
services, wait for them to shut down, edit, restart. This assures your
edits will not be tossed.

### Static content

See the file vhost.d/giscache.*
where you will see things set up for PDF files (surveys)
amd property photos (a separate microserver)
and the photoshow app (a separate service that is proxied)

For example, for surveys.

```bash
# Static content for survey documents, see also the volume entry in docker-compose.yml
location /PDF/ {
  root /mnt;
  autoindex on;
}
```

### Basic Auth

Create an htpasswd file and put it in the proxy_htpasswd volume
named for the virtual_host. In other words, do something like
"cp htpasswd proxy_htpasswd/_data/whoami.DOMAIN.COM"


### CORS support

To the proxy I added the nginx configuration to generate the right
HTTP headers to avoid Cross Origin Scripting (CORS) error messages.

In theory this is done with the "default_location" file,
but it looks like I have created separate files for each virtual server
that I proxy. For example I have geoserver.wildsong.biz_location
and then put a copy of that file in

   /var/lib/docker/volumes/proxy_vhost/_data/
   
which is the volume mounted at /etc/nginx/vhost.d in the proxy docker.

Currently I have set up these files to accept CORS requests from ANYWHERE.


### Checking out what's going on

All output directed to STDOUT and STDERR from Docker containers is
regarded as log data. I especially want to be able to analyze web logs
to see what interesting things are going on, so the docker-compose
file sets up logging.

You can check the contents of the volumes too, they are

* proxy_html -- letsencrypt uses this and needs to write files to it
* proxy_certs -- holds the letsencrypt certificates
* proxy_dhparam -- just holds the dhparam.pem file (this file gets copied to certs)

In the local space are more volumes,
* network_internal.conf -- rules on who can access this server
* vhost.d -- holds per-virtualhost config files
* nginx.tmpl --

nginx.tmpl is a file from the github repository for docker-gen.
You can copy it like this:

```bash
curl -o nginx.tmpl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwilder/docker-gen/master/templates/nginx.tmpl
```

and then edit it. I changed it to return a 444 instead of 503.
444 = just cut off the connection 503 = return an error page

I wanted to just drop the connection when a request for
https://YourIpAddress/ comes in but you have to send a self-signed
certificate because it has to set up a connection first and then drop it.

### What goes in the headers

This is what's in the default.conf file that gets built by dockergen.
See /var/lib/docker/volumes/proxy_conf/_data/default.conf

# HTTP 1.1 support
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_buffering off;
proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection $proxy_connection;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $proxy_x_forwarded_proto;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl $proxy_x_forwarded_ssl;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $proxy_x_forwarded_port;
# Mitigate httpoxy attack (see README for details)
proxy_set_header Proxy "";


## How to start the proxy

* Copy sample.env to .env
* Customize .env
* Launch it

```bash
SEE NOTE ABOVE on Stack VS Compose
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml proxy
```

I tend to run Docker Compose in testing because it dumps out tons of
debug messages on my console.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If it says it created a network called proxy_default you did something wrong.

### Some commands

Reload nginx reverse proxy without redeploy

    docker exec -it proxy_proxy* sh -c "nginx -s reload"
